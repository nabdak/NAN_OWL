# NAN_OWL
These are NAN's ontology files. I wrote these files from zero according to the passages I was working on to ensure a precise translation. These ontologies can provide the Arabic and the English meanings for the words regarding their contexts. 

Arabic is considered as one of the hardest languages to learn. As a result, translation is no better. The available translators are all still can't provide us the correct translations and this is why i needed to use the ontology. 

Have a nice time.
